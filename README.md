# Building-a-Kubernetes-Cluster-with-kubeadm 
This repository will allow you to practice the process of building a new Kubernetes cluster. You will be given a set of Linux servers, and you will have the opportunity to turn these servers into a functioning Kubernetes cluster.
This will help you build the skills necessary to create your own Kubernetes clusters in the real world.
